    <h1>Message From Our Pastor</h1>
    <p>Allow me to introduce Mountain View Fellowship to you
    (hopefully without telling you more than you want to know).</p>
    <p>Ours is an amazing story of God providing again and again for a
    growing group of clueless people, some of whom felt called to
    plant a church. We didn't start off with a group who got mad at
    somebody and broke off from another church. In fact we began with
    about 5 Church of the Brethren members called together by a
    district committee for the positive purpose of planting a new
    congregation in eastern Rockingham County.</p>
    <p>As this thing took off we soon grew large enough that we had to
    get out of people's living rooms. Worship space in a (crusty) old
    town hall building was one of many things that God provided. Later
    God found us a wonderful building site with a mountain view. We
    had named our church Mountain View Fellowship long before we
    received this site with the Massanutten peak as a backdrop--but
    God must have known.</p>
    <p>You can see photos elsewhere on our website of a large group of
    people building our church in 2006. The short explanation is that
    God directed us to a group called Carpenters for Christ from
    eastern Alabama, by way of Peoria, Illinois and Joplin,
    Missouri. There is a lot more we can tell you about that...</p>
    <p>So here we are, in beautiful McGaheysville, Virginia, with a
    growing congregation of 130 or so. Worship attendance averages
    80-90 and has grown each year since our beginning a decade ago. We
    have a good cross-section of age groups with a lot of
    children. Our folks come from a wide variety of denominational and
    church backgrounds, from a lot to a little, and many are
    relatively new residents in the area.</p>
    <p>We have worship every Sunday at 9:45 followed by fellowship and
    refreshments with Sunday school for all ages at 11:00 (or as soon
    as we can shoo them into their classes). We have "blended"
    worship, usually somewhere between contemporary and
    traditional. Dress is casual, and the atmosphere is welcoming. A
    core value is "worship that brings us into the presence of God and
    energizes us to action."</p>
    <p>Our regular activities include a Wednesday night prayer
    meeting, a monthly Soup and Sandwich Supper, and various events
    sponsored by our Hospitality Team or other church groups. Outreach
    to the community that addresses physical, emotional, and spiritual
    needs is an important part of our ministry. This includes filling
    backpacks with weekend food for local elementary school students
    and working with social services in making home repairs. We are
    also gaining some notoriety for our chicken barbecues which are
    for fundraising and fellowship and are held monthly, spring
    through fall.</p>
    <p>This gives you a glimpse. We invite you to "give us a look" and
    join us for worship or another activity. Questions? Feel free to
    call me at the church office 289-9008. I tell people I'm always
    there unless I'm somewhere else.</p>
    <p>Blessings, Wayne Pence, Pastor</p>
