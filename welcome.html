      <h1>Message From Our Pastor</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Allow me to introduce Mountain View Fellowship to you
        (hopefully without telling you more than you want to know).
      </p>
      <p>
        Ours is an amazing story of God providing again and again for
        a growing group of clueless people, some of whom felt called
        to plant a church. We didn't start off with a group who got
        mad at somebody and broke off from another church. In fact we
        began with about 5 Church of the Brethren members called
        together by a district committee for the positive purpose of
        planting a new congregation in eastern Rockingham County.
      </p>
      <p>
        As this thing took off we soon grew large enough that we had
        to get out of people's living rooms. Worship space in a
        (crusty) old town hall building was one of many things that
        God provided. Later God found us a wonderful building site
        with a mountain view. We had named our church Mountain View
        Fellowship long before we received this site with the
        Massanutten peak as a backdrop--but God must have known.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can see photos elsewhere on our website of a large group
        of people building our church in 2006. The short explanation
        is that God directed us to a group called Carpenters for
        Christ from eastern Alabama, by way of Peoria, Illinois and
        Joplin, Missouri. There is a lot more we can tell you about
        that...
      </p>
      <p>
        So here we are, in beautiful McGaheysville, Virginia, with a
        growing congregation of 130 or so. Worship attendance averages
        80-90 and has grown each year since our beginning a decade
        ago. We have a good cross-section of age groups with a lot of
        children. Our folks come from a wide variety of denominational
        and church backgrounds, from a lot to a little, and many are
        relatively new residents in the area.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have worship every Sunday at 9:45 followed by fellowship
        and refreshments with Sunday school for all ages at 11:00 (or
        as soon as we can shoo them into their classes). We have
        "blended" worship, usually somewhere between contemporary and
        traditional. Dress is casual, and the atmosphere is
        welcoming. A core value is "worship that brings us into the
        presence of God and energizes us to action."
      </p>
      <p>
        Our regular activities include a Wednesday night prayer
        meeting, a monthly Soup and Sandwich Supper, and various
        events sponsored by our Hospitality Team or other church
        groups. Outreach to the community that addresses physical,
        emotional, and spiritual needs is an important part of our
        ministry. This includes filling backpacks with weekend food
        for local elementary school students and working with social
        services in making home repairs. We are also gaining some
        notoriety for our chicken barbecues which are for fundraising
        and fellowship and are held monthly, spring through fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        This gives you a glimpse. We invite you to "give us a look"
        and join us for worship or another activity. Questions? Feel
        free to call me at the church office 289-9008. I tell people
        I'm always there unless I'm somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>Blessings, Wayne Pence, Pastor</p>
