            This is the inspiring story of how God answered our prayers in
            ways we never expected..
          </p>
          <h2>IN THE BEGINNING...</h2>
          <p>
            We met in homes and we were nothing if not creative. Worship
            here, fellowship there, education across the street... But as
            we grew we felt the need for a permanent home, housing all our
            ministries and members under a single roof.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the realties of the price and availability of land
            seemed to make this dream beyond our meager means and so we
            said "When God wants us to build, he will provide the
            land. Until then, let's get on with the business of praising
            His Glorious Name!"
          </p>
          <p>
            So, it was unlooked for when one day the phone rang and a
            realtor said "Are you the church looking to buy some land in
            McGaheysville?"
          </p>
