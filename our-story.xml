    <p>This is the inspiring story of how God answered our prayers in
    ways we never expected..</p>
    <h2>IN THE BEGINNING...</h2>
    <p>We met in homes and we were nothing if not creative. Worship
    here, fellowship there, education across the street... But as we
    grew we felt the need for a permanent home, housing all our
    ministries and members under a single roof.</p>
    <p>However, the realties of the price and availability of land
    seemed to make this dream beyond our meager means and so we said
    "When God wants us to build, he will provide the land. Until then,
    let's get on with the business of praising His Glorious Name!"</p>
    <p>So, it was unlooked for when one day the phone rang and a
    realtor said "Are you the church looking to buy some land in
    McGaheysville?"</p>
    <p>To be continued....</p>
